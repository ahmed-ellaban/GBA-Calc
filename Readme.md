## 5 whys technique:

1- what is the problem?
the problem is the complexity of getting gpa specaily if you fail with some subjects or under 2 gpa and the university
takes much time to tells the gpa
why is it a problem?
it takes much time to count it manually and it is hard to know if you are under 2 gpa or not
why does it happen?
because the gpa is calculated by the sum of the grades and the sum of the credit hours
2-who does it impact?
all students

3-what is the root cause?
the complexity of the calculation

4-what is the solution?
to create a program that calculates the gpa automatically, and the student can know his gpa at any time

5-how to implement the solution?
will create a simple website that takes the grades and the credit hours and calculates the gpa automatically and return
a table with all subjects and the gpa of them and the total gpa
