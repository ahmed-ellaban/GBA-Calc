## 5 Whys Technique: Understanding the GPA Calculation Issue

### 1. What is the problem?
The problem is the complexity of calculating GPA, especially if a student fails some subjects or has a GPA under 2. The university takes a considerable amount of time to provide GPA results.

### Why is it a problem?
Calculating GPA manually is time-consuming and it is challenging to determine immediately if one's GPA is under 2.

### Why does it happen?
GPA is calculated based on the sum of the grades weighted by the credit hours of the courses. The manual process and complexity of calculations lead to delays.

### 2. Who does it impact?
This issue impacts all students.

### 3. What is the root cause?
The root cause is the inherent complexity of the GPA calculation process, which involves multiple variables and conditions that are cumbersome to manage manually.

### 4. What is the solution?
The solution is to develop an automated program that calculates the GPA instantly. This allows students to access their GPA at any time without waiting for manual calculations.

### 5. How to implement the solution?
A simple website will be created where students can enter their grades and credit hours. The website will then automatically calculate the GPA for each subject and the total GPA, displaying the results in a comprehensible table format.

### 6. Mind Map Outline:
1. User Interface:
   - Input fields for grades and credit hours.
   - Submit button to process the GPA calculation.

2. Back-end Logic:
   - Functions to calculate GPA based on user input.
   - Logic to handle edge cases (e.g., failed subjects, GPA below 2).

3. Output:
   - Display a table listing all subjects, their respective GPAs, and the total GPA.
